### Step 3: Analyze Target Audience / ICP

Based on the extracted data, analyze who this brand is targeting.

**If user specified an audience** (e.g., "targeting first-time homebuyers"):
- Focus the ICP on that segment
- Connect their pain points to the brand's offerings
- Identify emotional triggers for that specific audience

**If no audience specified:**
- Derive ICP from the site's messaging, offerings, and testimonials
- Who are they clearly speaking to?
- What problems suggest a specific customer type?

**ICP Analysis Framework:**
```
WHO: Demographics + Situation
- Age range (infer from imagery, language, offerings)
- Life situation (renting, business owner, career stage)
- Financial situation (if relevant)

PAIN POINTS: What keeps them up at night?
- Specific frustrations (from site's messaging)
- Obstacles they face
- Fears or concerns

MOTIVATIONS: What do they want?
- Immediate goals
- Deeper desires (security, status, freedom, simplicity)

LANGUAGE: How do they talk?
- Terms they use (from testimonials)
- Level of sophistication
- Emotional vs. logical orientation
```

## Rules

1. **Be SPECIFIC** - Numbers, names, exact quotes (not "good rates" → "rates from 4.19%")
2. **Extract brand colors** - Hex codes if visible, clear descriptions if not
3. **Analyze ICP** - This is the ONE analysis you do; everything else is extraction
4. **Use exact quotes** - For testimonials and messaging, copy verbatim
5. **Note missing info** - If something isn't on the page, say so
6. **Keep it concise** - ~60-70 lines max

### Good (Specific):
```markdown

- Confusion about which mortgage product fits their situation

## Target Audience / ICP
**Focus:** Derived from site analysis

**WHO:**
- Self-employed professionals, 30-50, with complex income
- First-time buyers intimidated by traditional bank processes
- Homeowners looking to refinance but rejected elsewhere

**PAIN POINTS:**
- "Banks don't understand my income structure"
- Spent hours calling lenders, got different answers
- Fear of rejection damaging credit score

**MOTIVATIONS:**
- Get approved despite non-traditional situation
- Save time with one-stop comparison

```

### Bad (Vague):
```markdown
## The Offer
